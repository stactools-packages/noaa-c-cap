        <abstract>The NOAA Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) produces national standardized land cover and change products for the coastal regions of the U.S.  C-CAP products inventory coastal intertidal areas, wetlands, and adjacent uplands with the goal of monitoring changes in these habitats, on a one-to-five year repeat cycle. The timeframe for this metadata is reported as 2001-2016 Era, but the actual dates of the Landsat imagery used to create the land cover may have been acquired a few years before or after each era.  These maps are developed utilizing Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery, and can be used to track changes in the landscape through time.  This trend information gives important feedback to managers on the success or failure of management policies and programs and aid in developing a scientific understanding of the Earth system and its response to natural and human-induced changes. This understanding allows for the prediction of impacts due to these changes and the assessment of their cumulative effects, helping coastal resource managers make more informed regional decisions. NOAA C-CAP is a contributing member to the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics consortium and C-CAP products are included as the coastal expression of land cover within the National Land Cover Database.</abstract>
        <purpose>C-CAP is dedicated to the development, distribution, and application of land cover and change data for the coastal regions of the U.S. This effort is being conducted in close coordination with state coastal management agencies, the interagency Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) consortium, and the National Land Cover Database (NLCD).

        <accuracy>An accuracy assessment was performed on the 2010-era C-CAP products.  Reports detailing the methods, overall, and individual  class accuracies can be found at https://coast.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/publications/regional-reports</accuracy>
        <completeness-report>Data does not exist for all classes. Class 1 (Unclassified) is intentionally left blank. All pixels have been  classified.</completeness-report>
        <conceptual-consistency>Tests for logical consistency indicate that all row and column positions in the selected  latitude/longitude window contain data. Conversion and integration with vector files indicates that all positions are consistent with  earth coordinates covering the same area. Attribute files are logically consistent.</conceptual-consistency>

                <description>This dataset was created by NOAA's Office for Coastal Management, through the Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP).  The data is based upon the post classification comparison of 2001 and 2016 era C-CAP land cover classifications.  ERDAS Imagine was used to create a matrix file between the two selected dates of land cover.</description>
