      <procstep>
        <procdesc>This data set was created by Dewberry (www.dewberry.com). This version of the classification is the High Resolution Land Cover (2010-era) for the Island of Puerto Rico.
This section outlines the classification procedure for the Puerto Rico High Resolution C-CAP. The color-infrared imagery used in producing this land cover product was also utilized in producing an associated impervious surfaces layer for the island. Non impervious features were mapped using a 0.25 acre minimum mapping unit (MMU) and impervious features were mapped using a 0.1 acre MMU.
Image Preparation: The aerial imagery was supplied to Dewberry by the USACE. Due to quality issues during acquisition, the USACE had to perform additional post processing on the imagery to make it suitable for land cover mapping. Dewberry received the imagery on December 17, 2012 and performed a QA review to inspect and document voids, clouds/smoke cover, inconstant radiometry, shadows, and artifacts. Individual image tiles were merged into a single mosaic and re-sampled from the native 1-foot spatial resolution to 2-m.
Automated Land Cover Classification: An Object Based Image Analysis (OBIA) approach was used to automate the preliminary land cover results. This approach uses eCognition software that groups pixels that share similar spectral properties based on the user's defined parameters and organizes these groups into polygons through a process called segmentation. Once the aerial imagery was segmented into image objects the land cover classification was performed using thresholding, thematic, and supervised classification processes in eCognition.
Classification Review: Once various stages of the automated land cover classification processing were completed, the resulting land cover was edited manually by Dewberry's aerial photointerpreters using ERDAS Imagine software. The land cover was reviewed for geometry and classification errors and corrected using ERDAS' raster editing tools. A 30 meter land cover map was created from the 2 meter product by performing a majority focal analysis and incorporating the percent impervious values in accordance with the C-CAP 30 meter class definitions (High Intensity Developed &gt; 79% impervious, Medium Intensity Developed &gt; 49% impervious, and Low Intensity Developed &gt; 19% impervious).
Map Finalization: Dewberry used independent reviewer's comments to further refine the land cover map.

less than 5 meters in height, and all such
wetlands that occur in tidal areas in which salinity due
to ocean-derived salts is above 0.5 ppt.</edomvd>

            <edomvd>Characterized by erect, rooted, herbaceous hydrophytes
(excluding mosses and lichens) that are present for most
of the growing season in most years. Perennial plants
usually dominate these wetlands. All water regimes are
included except those that are sub-tidal and irregularly
exposed.</edomvd>

            <edomvd>Characterized by substrates lacking vegetation except for
pioneering plants that become established during brief
periods when growing conditions are favorable. Erosion and
deposition by waves and currents produce a number of
landforms, such as beaches, bars, and flats, all of which
are included in this class.</edomvd>

and Estuarine Systems, where they occupy substrates
characterized by a wide range of sediment depths and
textures. They occur in both the sub-tidal and inter-tidal
Subsystems and may grow to depths of 30 m (98 feet).
This class includes kelp forests.</edomvd>
